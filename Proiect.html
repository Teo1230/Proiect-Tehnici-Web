        Yves Henri Donat Mathieu-Saint-Laurent (1 August 1936 – 1 June 2008), referred to as Yves Saint-Laurentor YSL,
        was a French fashion designer who, in 1962, founded his eponymous fashion label. He is regarded as being among
        the foremost fashion designers of the twentieth century. In 1985, Caroline Milbank wrote, "The most consistently
        celebrated and influential designer of the past twenty-five years, Yves Saint Laurent can be credited with both
        spurring the couture's rise from its 1960s ashes and with finally rendering ready-to-wear reputable."He
        developed his style to accommodate the changes in fashion during that period. He approached his aesthetic from a
        different perspective by helping women find confidence by looking both comfortable and elegant at the same time.
        He is also credited with having introduced the "Le Smoking" tuxedo suit for women and was known for his use of
        non-European cultural references and of diverse models.

      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item">In 1953, Saint Laurent submitted three sketches to a contest for young fashion designers
          organized by the International Wool Secretariat. Saint Laurent won first place. Subsequently, he was invited
          to attend the awards ceremony held in Paris in December of that same year.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">In August 1957, Dior met with Saint Laurent's mother to tell her that he had chosen Saint
          Laurent to succeed him as a designer. His mother later said that she had been confused by the remark, as Dior
          was only 52 years old at the time. Both she and her son were surprised when in October of that year Dior died
          at a health spa in northern Italy of a massive heart attack.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">In 1957, Saint Laurent found himself at age 21 the head designer of the House of Dior.
          His spring 1958 collection almost certainly saved the enterprise from financial ruin. The simple, flaring
          lines of his first collection for Dior, called the Trapeze line, a variation of Dior's 1955 A-Line, catapulted
          him to international stardom.</div>
        <div class="grid-item">His fall 1958 collection was not greeted with the same level of approval as his first
          collection and later collections for the House of Dior featuring hobble skirts and beatnik fashions were
          savaged by the press</div>
        <div class="grid-item">In 1959, he was chosen by Farah Diba, who was a student in Paris, to design her wedding
          dress for her marriage to the Shah of Iran</div>
        <div class="grid-item">In 1960, Saint Laurent found himself conscripted to serve in the French Army during the
          Algerian War of Independence. Alice Rawsthorn writes that there was speculation at the time that Marcel
          Boussac, the owner of the House of Dior and a powerful press baron, had put pressure on the government not to
          conscript Saint Laurent in 1958 and 1959, but after the disastrous 1958 season, reversed course and asked that
          the designer be conscripted so that he could be replaced. </div>
